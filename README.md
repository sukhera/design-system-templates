# Design System Templates

This repository is a collection of reusable design systems generated with AI
(Claude, ChatGPT) for different product types:

- SaaS dashboards
- E-commerce stores
- Authentication flows
- Landing pages
- Developer portfolios

Each system lives under `systems/<name>/` and contains:

- `tokens/` – colors, spacing, typography tokens
- `components/` – UX + component specs
- `layouts/` – page-level structures
- `themes/` – light/dark/brand variations
- `examples/` – example screens and flows
- `prompts/` – the AI prompts used to generate the system
